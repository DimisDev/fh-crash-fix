2. Press I don't have that users Microsoft account, then Create the account without Microsoft account. Create account with name ```limiteduser```, and input an easy password like 123
3. Make Sure that the User is ```Standart User``` and create it.
4. Download the bat file in the repositorie
5. Run the bat file (desktop,taskbar etc. will dissapear for a few seconds) and enter the password you used for limiteduser
